# This script designed to be used a docker ENTRYPOINT "workaround" missing docker
# feature discussed in docker/docker#7198, allow to have executable in the docker
# container manipulating files in the shared volume owned by the USER_ID:GROUP_ID.

# It creates a user named `aosp` with selected USER_ID and GROUP_ID (or
# 1000 if not specified).
#
# Example:
#  docker run -ti -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) imagename bash
